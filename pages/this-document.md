# Author’s Note

My name is Meri Leeworthy, I'm a self-taught programmer (among other things) and I've been working on some version of this project for over two years. I've had the support of a small group of people, and together we've created an
organisation called Radical Directory (which I'll talk about in the next
document). This work has been my passion. When I started working on it, I knew
relatively little about how software development works, but I was very confident
I could learn quickly and somehow scrape together something that would support the work of grassroots activists. As time has gone on, my skills and knowledge have improved and accordingly I have a much [clearer understanding of my limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect) as a programmer.

This proposal tries to describe a software project that starts big and grows to
be enormous, complex, and multifaceted. At this stage I'm slightly less
concerned about what is 'viable' and more about what would it actually take to
make a substantial impact on how political action is organised online, how we
communicate, how we access and produce information. I am interested to deeply consider what the social and political implications for a given technological idea might be, to determine whether these align with our values, and then to build alliances and coalitions between interested parties to bring those ideas into being. I think it's important to dream big, as well as being pragmatic.

I've had a lot of successive ideas about how to use existing technology,
frameworks, protocols etc to support the sharing of information about events and organisations online in a way that is broadly accessible and protects the
privacy and autonomy of communities. This proposal is simply the latest
iteration and I'm open to hearing that it is flawed or problematic in some way.
There are many gaps in my knowledge both political and technical, which is why
I'm sharing this publicly to get feedback.

For anyone interested, I wrote some things about my political and philosophical
lineages of thought and practice [here](politics.md). I also have a personal [website](https://meri.garden) if you'd like to know more about (or hire!) me.

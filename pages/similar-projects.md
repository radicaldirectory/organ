In its use case and project goals, Organ has significant overlap with an
existing project called [Mobilizon](https://mobilizon.org/en/). However there are a few critical differences
between them which explain why a seperate project is proposed.

Mobilizon implements the ActivityPub protocol to federate between instances.

This should
drastically reduce the cost of development compared to Mobilizon.

The intention of this project is not to ‘compete’ with Mobilizon but to
respectfully take a different approach and expand the fediverse for everyone.
Naturally, a high priority is integration and interoperability including with
ActivityPub and Mobilizon. If Organ is successfully implemented, the custom spec
extension should be put to Matrix as formal MSC Proposal(s) so that other
clients can implement the novel features.
